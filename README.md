# Problem Statement
A company is looking to regulate over-stocking and under-stocking products to meet the exact needs of their customers. Therefore they want to identify product categories with the highest potential customer demand by analyzing key indicators such as price ranges, review volumes, and average customer ratings. This insight will help prioritize high-performing categories for marketing, inventory planning, or strategic investment.
# Task
Your task is to approach market demand from a value and pricing perspective, asking: which product offers the most from the consumer’s point of view? You could estimate the average price per product for each product. Then calculate the ratio of average rating to price — this can be used as a simple signal of perceived value (e.g., products that are low-priced but highly rated may reflect high demand and satisfaction).
# Hypothesis:
Product categories with higher review volume, competitive pricing, and strong average ratings are more likely to exhibit high customer demand.
# Analysis Plan:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Feature Engineering
- Aggregation
- Scoring or Ranking
- Visualization
- Recommendation
